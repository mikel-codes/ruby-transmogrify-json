## Fixing the structured log files

I made a mistake.  I was asked to go to a bunch of servers and download the log files to a central location so that they would be easy to review.  The log files were all in a JSON format, so I figured I could just concatenate them together to have fewer files in the directory.  Later I was told that they are actually 3 different formats that are similar, but have significant
differences.  

### Required Transformations

Here are the differences that need resolved between the formats:

* some dates are numeric in seconds since epoch
* some dates are numeric in milliseconds since epoch
* some dates are in an ISO string format
* a log record may have 1 or more `events` records that produces a separate log record per event
* in some records,`indicator-level` maps to `severity` by mapping:
          1 - TRACE, 2 - DEBUG, 3..5 INFO, 6..8 WARN, 9..10 ERROR
* in some records, `indicator-type` and `indicator-value` are concatenated to form the `message` field
* ... but when `indicator-type` contains the text "message", then only the `indicator-value` is used to form the `message` field
* the `source` field is mapped into the `process` field for output

Please help by writing a function that takes as input the mixed up concatenated log records I created, and converts them into the normalized correct format.  The JSON parsing is handled for you, and so is the serialization back into JSON.  

See example log files below.

## Getting started:

In the `lib/types.rb` file you will find a `LogEvent` class to use for your output.  In `lib/transmogrify.rb` is where you may start writing your code.  Add any other classes, helper functions, utilitiy functions, and tests that you think are appropriate.  But be careful not to change the main method signature or tests would break.  Tests are in `tests` directory and there is a sample input `tests/transmogrify-input.json` and a sample result `tests/transmogrify-output.json`.  Even though you are not dealing with the JSON directly, these are helpful to view.

### Installing

To install dependencies:

```
bundle install --path vendor/bundle
```

### Running tests:

To run tests:

```
bundle exec rake test
```

## Log formats
